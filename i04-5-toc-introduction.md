INTRODUCTION

1. Earlier lexicographical work on Igbo.

Igbo has been strangely neglected by lexicographers.
Probably the main reasons for this neglect have been the
considerable variation between the dialects of Igbo, noted from the beginning of Igbo studies, and the lack of a single
early authoritative figure to impose a standard written
language, as Crowther did for Yoruba.

Recently, the publication by Beatrice P. Welmers and William E. Welmers of Igho: a learner's dictionary (U.C.L.A., 1968) has done something to fill the gap." As the title implies, this is a work for learners, and the vocabulary is
therefore restricted, although the words included are freely and helpfully illustrated in sentences. The authors include
a brief review of four earlier Igbo works concerned partly
or wholly with lexicography (Adans 1932, Swift and others 1962, Green and Igwe 1963, Ogbalu 1962), and their comments will not be repeated here. Several works can, however, be
added to the list.

The earliest Igbo dictionary (as opposed to the early wordlists)2 to be published was Crowther's Vocabulary of the
Ibo language (1882), to which Schön added Part II: English-Ibo

2. Some wordlists, however, reached a considerable length, notably that by Norris (1841).

in 1883. Hair (1967:86) gives the following account origin of Crowther's dictionary:

'He came to the conclusion that translation work was held back by the problem of dialects, and that more mist learnt before a fira policy could be evolved. To this in the late 1870s he ordered the missionaries at Onitsha begin work on a comparative dictionary of Ibo dialecte, This ambitious enterprise was not carried out, mainly bec of lack of able researchers, but such material as did beco available Crowther put together to form a dictionary....

In 190, Ganot published an English, Too and French dictionary, based on the Onitsha dialect.

Northcote E. Thomas devoted four of the six volumes of his Anthropological report on the Ibo-speaking peoples of Miserfs to language, three of them being essentially lexicographic. Part II (1913) consists of an English-Too and Too-English dictionary, based on the Awka and Onitaha dialects. It has a rather complex and non-phonemic trans cription of the vowels; tone is partially marked. Part III (1913) consists of Proverbs, narratives, vocabularies and Grass, the vocabularies being of Awka, Oniča (Onitsha), Abo (Aboh), Ivitemu, and 93á (the last two being apparently extreme northern dialects). These vocabularies are based on the same list that Thomas uses in his Specimens of Languages from Southern Nigeria (1914), in which he gives
lists from 26 dialects of Igbo and closely related languages. Part V (1914) consists of Addends to Tbo-English dictionarz; apart from corrections to Part 11, this volume adds a large amount of material from the Asaba dict. In general, Thomas's material is extensive, but inadequately transcribed and analyzed.

The C.M.S. mission at Onitsha undertook the collection of a considerable amount of lexical material. Several copies of a typescript Ibo-English dictionary, edited by T. J. Dennis, 1 are in existence." The material is stated in the introduction to be mostly from 'Onitsha and its neighbourhood'; it was collected by 'Miss Warner and other Missionaries and Native Agents of the C.M.8.', and alphabetically arranged by the Hon. L. E. Portman and Mise Bird. A number of words are marked as being from Abq (Aboh), çka (Awka), or other dialects. No date is given on the typescript, but it is dated about the year 1906' in the preface to a companion work, a Dictionary of the Too language: English-Too (1923). This latter work was also largely the responsibility of Dennis, and it is listed under his name in bibliographies, although his name does not appear on the title-page. The preface to this book gives its history as follows:
